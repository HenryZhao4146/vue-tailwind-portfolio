                cool? A Discord bot that lets you own dinosaurs. Keep scrolling to read the epic tale of DinoBot.

            <p>Once upon a time, all the continents were stuck together like overcooked mac and cheese, forming the Pangea
                supercontinent. Here roamed dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. Far from living in harmony, though, many
                dinosaurs engaged in predatory behavior and would've folded you into a pretzel regardless of how tough you
                act behind your keyboard. But rather than fearing these magnificent beasts, you should harness their power.
                DinoBot's vibrant virtual economy lets you buy dinosaurs, which are then yours to customize, train, breed,
                and most importantly, send to war against other players. The more your dinos fight, the better they'll
                become at it. And the better they fight, the more resources you plunder to finance a bigger army.
